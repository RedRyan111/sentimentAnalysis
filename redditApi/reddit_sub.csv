1532344299,Please review my thesis on the motivation for the Berlin Wall,"As a student of history, I have developed an unconventional thesis on the assessment of the Berlin Wall. Please read with an open mind:

Just last month, my father was stationed in Germany for a while in the telecom contract project for my company. He has been to Germany many times because of his work and know many people from companies like Vodafone and Nokia. I remember CNN on the night of Celebration of some anniversary of the collapse of the Wall, where the German Chancellor came to speak to a large crowd outside the Brandenburg Gate, and Hilary Clinton also spoke. At the end of the ceremony, the organizers had a segment in which about 12 life-size ""walls"" were sequentially arranged and toppled as a domino, symbolizing the ""fall"" of all the ""walls"" of the dictatorship of the world and the ultimate victory of liberal democracy , Then something very dramatic happened, at the last stage of the domino was a wall with clearly Chinese characters and symbols on it, not sure why it was Chinese, maybe just a coincidence. But this last wall, which refused to fall, came the organizers and tried to push them to complete the Domino, but somehow he got stuck, stood up and refused to move. In an anti-climatic mood, they had to end this ""incomplete"" domino show by accusing technical issues. Rarely has this little ""embarrassment"" ever been mentioned again. 

Over the Berlin Wall, I never believed that it was an ' evil ' thing, as the liberal Western media always claimed. First, the Soviet Union has never built similar baroque in its own country to prevent its citizens from fleeing to the west, never building similar walls in any other Eastern European country, never building such a wall in other adjacent Countries. Why should this wall only be built in East Germany?

We all know that the German people committed massive crimes during the Second World War. During the war, German citizens killed a large number of Soviet soldiers, a large number of Jews and mostly Germans supported Hitler's policy against the Jews. During the late phase of the war, when the Red Army invaded Berlin, the Berliners attacked the weapons to fight the Soviet soldiers, including German children and seniors. Many Soviet soldiers, when their guards crashed, were killed by bombs on the road and other surprised attacks by German civilians, which were very similar to the present situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. If the German people gave up the resistance earlier, the Allies would have won the war sooner, and much less lives would have been lost.

Therefore, we can conclude that the German-Civilian population has committed a collective crime. If there were less than 100 people who committed a crime that deserves the death penalty, then these people could simply be executed as in Nuremberg. But if there is much more than 100, say 200,000 people, then the execution of 200,000 people is too cruel, too impractical. So, an alternative punishment, that the Soviet Union had a temporary restriction on the mobility and freedom of these criminals, similar to a prison.

Thus the construction of the Berlin Wall is only a massive Jailhouse for the criminals who were the German people. Of course, not all crimes against Allied soldiers have been committed within the German population. There were only a few courageous **antikriegsgegner**, anti-fascist heroes, such as the former East German communist leader Erich Honecker. That is why it was natural for people like Erich Honecker to be instructed to lead the efforts in the maintenance of this wall.

And that is the main reason why many inmates from East Germany tried to flee to West Germany, which is interpreted by the Western media as ' escape to freedom '. But it was really just illegal jailbreak attempts. If you try to break out of a prison, the prison wardens will have the right to shoot you.

And while I have had some discussions in Germany about the Berlin Wall and the post-Cold War situation in Germany. While many West German liberal intellectuals all welcomed the fall of the wall as a victory for the German people, many East German intellectuals had many complaints, complaints about the fall of their pensions, the decay of their income, the erosion of social security, etc. After the fall of the wall, and most of the old East German intellectuals and residents still think that the fall of the wall was a tragedy in itself. I of course with the East Germans. "
1532344299,Pre-paid mobile,"I am visiting Fiji for a week soon and would like to be able to contact people via mobile data. Before you scold me I won't spend half of my holiday on my phone but would like to have the ability to communicate with family back home if needed.

I have the option of buying a roaming data pack from my provider here in Aus but it is pricey and was wondering if I can get a pre-paid sim with a data bundle for a reasonable price. Vodafone Fiji has some pricing on it's website but the information seems to be out of date. Will I need to buy a pre-paid pack with SMS and calling mins before I can buy a data bundle or can I just get a data bundle?"
1532344299,Got sent an unsolicited iPad from Vodafone. Anyone familiar with Victorian consumer law?,"Last Friday Vodafone rang me and asked if I wanted to up my data usage, as I frequently go over my allowance. The phone called lasted about ten minutes and I ummed and ahhed about it but eventually opted out. My reasoning was that I didn’t want them to send me a new SIM card because I have no use for it and it’s wasteful. According to them, the deal just comes with a new SIM card, no way around it. Whatever, I figure I can just go into a store and tell them to hold the SIM card, and my plan doesn’t roll over for a few weeks anyway. At one stage during the call they tried to push an iPad on to me, it was difficult to fully grasp the conditions of the iPad due to a thick accent and the ridiculously quick talking pace of the salesman. During the call I did at one stage agree to an increased data plan (pulling out towards the end of the call) but at no stage of the call did I agree to an iPad. I explicitly said that I have no use for one and do not want one. At the end of the call I made it very clear that I did no want any upgrade or additional devices etc etc. 

Later that day I got a text from Vodafone saying I could track my order. Huh, weird, as I didn’t actually order anything. Sure enough, an iPad is on the way. Today said iPad arrived and was signed for by another resident of my address. 

I haven’t opened the iPad, it is still in its full packaging, plastic seal and all. If I do have to return it, it will be fine for resale etc. 

Being the poor scumbag I am, I wanna know if I have any grounds to keep the iPad without paying for it (judge me all you want). Not the most moral thing to do, but hey, I could seriously do with the money from selling this sucker and I genuinely did not order it. 

I imagine I will get billed for it on my next billing cycle. I have the time and date of the call saved so they can look up the recording when I dispute the charge. 

Is anyone familiar with Victorian consumer law that can offer some insight? "
